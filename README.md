**PurEco - Individual Github**

--------------------------------------

I am Liza Gugieva, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of PurEco. I focused on contributing to the technical and visual development of our microbial air purification system.

As CTO, I specialized in the productâ€™s design, engineering feasibility, and visual representation. My primary role was to translate our scientific concept into a functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing product. This included creating detailed design mockups, 3D models, and diagrams to effectively communicate how the product would operate both as a standalone unit and when integrated into existing HVAC systems.

I collaborated closely with our CEO, CFO, and research team to ensure that the design aligned with our biological mechanisms and market needs. I was also responsible for integrating feedback from customer discovery sessions into the design process, which helped us greatly improve on the visuals to reflect real-world constraints and user preferences.

In addition, I played a key role in developing presentation materials, making sure that our pitch deck and visuals clearly conveyed our innovation and value proposition. My work helped bridge the gap between complex bioengineering concepts and clear, approachable product communication.
